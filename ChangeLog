  Added initial SSDP server capabilities and UPnP client capabilities.
  VERY EXPERIMENTAL!

	* src/Mono.Ssdp.ConsoleClient/Mono.Ssdp.ConsoleClient/ConsoleClient.cs:
	Implemented a proper console client that supports browsing against multiple
	search targets and verbose logging

	* docs/en/Mono.Ssdp/Service.xml:
	* docs/en/Mono.Ssdp/BrowseService.xml:
	* docs/en/Mono.Ssdp/Browser.xml:
	* docs/en/Mono.Ssdp/Client.xml:
	* docs/en/index.xml: Updated docs

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp.Internal/Log.cs: Fix compile

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp/Client.cs: Added a static StrictProtocol bool
	that can disable the strict implementation of the SSDP protocol; turning
	strict off might be necessary in some cases if a user finds that the
	UPnP devices they're interacting with don't actually implement SSDP \
	properly

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp/Service.cs: Split Service into a base Service
	class and moved browse specific code to BrowseService; make Location a
	collection/enumerable since multiple Locations can be specified

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp/BrowseService.cs: Implement proper Location/AL
	parsing and strict header parsing per the SSDP 'spec' as documented in
	the UPnP Design by Example book from Intel Press

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp/Browser.cs:
	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp.Internal/NotifyListener.cs: Added exception
	handling and throwing for when datagrams can't be parsed

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp.Internal/Log.cs: Added a basic logger so we
	don't just silently dismiss excetions; logger can be enabled by setting
	MONO_SSDP_DEBUG environment variable

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp.Internal/ServiceCache.cs: Do proper 
	merge/updating with GENA NOTIFY service datagrams instead of creating
	a new service

2008-07-21  Aaron Bockover  <abock@gnome.org>

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp/Client.cs: Add ServiceTypeRegistered method
	returning true if an NT/ST value has been registered by a browser child

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp/Service.cs: Support expiration by parsing the
	'Cache-Control: max-age=SEC' header or the 'Expires' header

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp.Internal/NotifyListener.cs: Do not register
	services that come in via NOTIFY if a browse has not been created for 
	the service type in question

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp.Internal/Protocol.cs: Create a const for ssdp:all

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp.Internal/ServiceCache.cs: Register service
	expiration timeouts with the new TimeoutDispatcher and expire them if
	they ever time out

	* src/Mono.Ssdp/Mono.Ssdp.Internal/TimerDispatcher.cs: Support handler
	re-registration and cancelation

	* src/Mono.Ssdp.ConsoleClient/Mono.Ssdp.ConsoleClient/ConsoleClient.cs:
	Show timestamps for debugging

	* Mono.Ssdp: Initial Import
