One of the implementation goals of Mono.Upnp is to eliminate all
NullReferenceExceptions. If you dereference an argument in a method which can be
called from client code (this includes protected methods), you should check the
argument for null at the start of the method and throw ArgumentNullException.
If you derefernce an object returned from potentially external code, you need
to null-check the object and either throw an exception or not dereference.
Ideally, the only exception types to come out of the Mono.Upnp library are
ArgumentException, ArgumentOutOfRangeException, ArgumentNullException,
InvalidOperationException, ObjectDisposedException or an exception type we
define.
