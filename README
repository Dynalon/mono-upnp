WARNING: Mono.Ssdp and Mono.UPnP are under initial development. They are not
         meant to be used at all unless you are actively working on them!

Mono.Ssdp provides a fully managed implementation of the Simple Service
Discovery Protocol. SSDP is used primarily for discovery of UPnP services
on a local administrative network.

Mono.Upnp provides a fully managed implementation of the Universal Plug
and Play standard. It enables both browsing for and broadcasting of
UPnP services.
